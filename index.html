        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! My name is Ruslana, and I'm a dedicated and accomplished Computer Scientist currently pursuing my Master of 
          Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech. I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science 
          from UC Bereley in 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I've focused on honing my technical skills specializing in Machine Learning,
          Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Natural Language Processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional journey has seen me excel in internships at Amazon and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, where I 
          devised and implemented automation tools and machine learning models, showcasing my adeptness in problem-solving. Beyond 
          practical experience, I have had the privilege of imparting knowledge as a Teaching Assistant and leading as the President of 
          the Association of Women in EE&CS at UC Berkeley.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delving into projects and research, I've had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge initiatives such as Zoning Codes and LLMs
          and Automatic Facial Keypoint Detection, utilizing technologies like Python and OpenAI API. Balancing my technological prowess, 
          I cherish diverse hobbies such as ballet, contemporary dance, knitting, crocheting, puzzles, and indulging in fantasy novels. 
          This blend of technology and creativity propels me forward, and I am eager to contribute my multifaceted skills to the dynamic
          world of Computer Science and beyond.
