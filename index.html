        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, I'm Ruslana! I'm currently getting my Masters of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell University. 
          In 2023, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science 
          (Berkeley AND Cornell? I'm really collecting the bear mascots).
          Lately, I've been diving deep into sharpening my tech skills, especially in Computer Vision, 
          Computer Graphics, and Natural Language Processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've had some awesome internships at places like Amazon and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, working on projects 
          with automation tools and machine learning. Now, I'm on the hunt for a full-time position where I can keep learning and 
          apply my skills!
        </p>
        <p>
          While at Cal, I had the privilege of being a TA for the <a href="https://cs61a.org/">largest undergraduate course</a> (1,500+ students!). 
          I also was the President of <a href="https://awe.berkeley.edu/">the Association of Women in EE&CS</a>, 
          and championed diversity and inclusion as the DE&I Chair <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/">Computer Science Mentors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, at Cornell Tech, I'm working with Sasha Rush on a research project that uses LLMs to extract information from large legal documents. I'm also continuing my 
          focus on classes in Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision. When I'm not studying, you can find me sitting in a park reading a good 
          fantasy novel, exploring the best food in NYC (check out my <a href="https://beliapp.co/lists/rusy">Beli page</a>), and crafting (i like to knit and crochet).
