        My professional journey has seen me excel in internships at Amazon and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, where I 
        devised and implemented automation tools and machine learning models, showcasing my adeptness in problem-solving. Beyond 
        practical experience, I have had the privilege of imparting knowledge as a Teaching Assistant and leading as the President of 
        the Association of Women in EE&CS at UC Berkeley.

        Delving into projects and research, I've had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge initiatives such as Zoning Codes and LLMs
         and Automatic Facial Keypoint Detection, utilizing technologies like Python and OpenAI API. Balancing my technological prowess, 
         I cherish diverse hobbies such as ballet, contemporary dance, knitting, crocheting, puzzles, and indulging in fantasy novels. 
         This blend of technology and creativity propels me forward, and I am eager to contribute my multifaceted skills to the dynamic
         world of Computer Science and beyond.
