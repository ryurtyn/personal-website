        Hey, I'm Ruslana! I've recently completed my Masters of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech. Prior to that, I graduated 
        from UC Berkeley in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science (Berkeley AND Cornell? I'm really 
        collecting the bear mascots).

        At Cornell Tech, I had an incredible experience working on various advanced tech projects. I was the runner-up for the Startup Award
        with my startup, mercuryVote. I also delved into NLP research with Sasha Rush, focusing on using LLMs to extract information from 
        large legal documents. Additionally, I explored computer vision and AI to extract procedural information from egocentric task-based
         videos at the XR Collaboratory. My coursework included a strong focus on Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision.

        During my time at UC Berkeley, I had the privilege of being a TA for the largest undergraduate course (1,500+ students!). I also served 
        as the President of the Association of Women in EE&CS and championed diversity and inclusion as the DE&I Chair for Computer Science Mentors.

      Beyond my academic pursuits, I've had some awesome internships at Amazon and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, where I worked 
      on projects involving automation tools and machine learning.

      Now, I'm getting ready to start a full-time position where I can continue to learn and apply my skills. When I'm not working on tech projects, 
      you can find me sitting in a park reading a good fantasy novel, exploring the best food in NYC (check out my Beli page), and crafting 
      (I like to knit and crochet).
